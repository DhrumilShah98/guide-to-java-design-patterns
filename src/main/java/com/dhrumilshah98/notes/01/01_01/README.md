# What is a Design pattern?
Design patterns are a way of reusing other people's knowledge and experience. 

Design patterns are like a recipes.

__Example Analogy:__ Imagine someone who wants to cook a lasagna. They don't have to come up with how to make it themselves. Lots of people have already made lasagnas, so instead they can follow a receipe and reuse the knowledge of someone who's already taken the time to come up with a good way to do it.

Each design pattern is a solution to a common coding problem.

Design patterns are not specific to a certain technology.

__Example Analogy:__ A cookbook doesn't provide you with an actual lasagna. It just gives you guidelines on how to make one. Similarly, a design pattern doesn't give you an actual code to use. It's just a guideline or template on how to solve a common problem.
